What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","  Ans - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991\n","      **why is it popular becasue of following reason ...\n","      1.Easy to Learn and Read\n","      2.Versatile and Powerful\n","      3.Large Community Support\n","      4.Extensive Libraries and Frameworks\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-2  What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","  Ans - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line translating it into machine-readable instructions that your computer can understand.In simple terms When you write Python code, it’s written in human-readable form like English.\n","  The Python interpreter takes that code and converts it into instructions your computer’s processor can execute.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-3  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","  Ans - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings in the Python language.You cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers because Python uses them for its syntax and structure.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-4  Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","   Ans - No, Keyword can't used as variable names.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-5 What is mutability in Python ?\n","   Ans - Mutability means the ability of an object to be modified (changed) after creation.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-6  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","   Ans - A **list** is designed to store and modify data.\n","         A **tuple**, on the other hand, is designed for fixed data.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-7 What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","   Ans - “==” It is compare the value which means It checks whether the data inside the objects is equal.\n","   “is” It is compares the identity which means It checks whether both variables point to the same object in memory.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-8  What are logical operators in Python ?\n","   Ans - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return a Boolean value (True or False) based on logical relationships.\n","   Types of logical operator in python --\n","   1. and operator\n","   2. or operator\n","   3. not operator\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-9  What is type casting in Python ?\n","   Ans - Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another — for example, turning an integer into a string, or a string into a float.\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-10  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","  Ans - Implicit Casting: Python handles it automatically (safe conversions).\n","\n","Explicit Casting: You manually convert data types using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-11  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","  Ans - Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program — they allow the program to execute certain code only if a specific condition is true.\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-12 How does the elif statement work ?\n","   Ans - 1. Python first checks the if condition.\n","\n","         2. If if is False, it checks the elif condition (if present).\n","\n","         3. You can have multiple elif statements to test multiple conditions.\n","\n","         4. If none of the conditions are True, the else block (if present) runs.\n","\n","\n","\n","Ques-13 What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","   Ans - for loop ---\n","     1 Used to iterate over a sequence\n","     2 Iterates a fixed number of times\n","     3 Use for when you know how many times to iterate.\n","\n","     while loop ---\n","     1 Used to repeat code while a condition is True\n","     2 Iterates as long as a condition remains True\n","     3 Use while when you want to loop until a condition changes\n","\n","\n","Ques-14  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n","   Ans - Suppose you want to keep asking the user to enter a password until they enter the correct one.You don’t know in advance how many attempts it will take.So a for loop (which iterates a fixed number of times) won’t work well here.\n","\n","\n","      \n"],"metadata":{"id":"XPsY9w07sIFx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"q4xt8p3333Ya","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760464746539,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Shivam Sharma","userId":"05968237231871837168"}},"outputId":"00b600a4-65ce-4c8c-b9c6-192b03829248"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a Python program that displays your name and age\n","\n","print(\"My name is Shivam Sharma and my age is 22\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AW9uzTbD4Dbv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760464844153,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Shivam Sharma","userId":"05968237231871837168"}},"outputId":"9bd02f32-ebcb-4ade-ff06-a191f3d5dd5a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["My name is Shivam Sharma and my age is 22\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library\n","\n","\n","import keyword\n","\n","print(keyword.kwlist)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ut26xOaW4bQ9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760465029193,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Shivam Sharma","userId":"05968237231871837168"}},"outputId":"a42fb018-e329-4631-ceb7-29ddd87eb097"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n","import keyword\n","\n","word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n","\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","    print(f\"{word} is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"{word} is not a Python keyword.\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lEDe8xUr439t","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760465116273,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5019,"user":{"displayName":"Shivam Sharma","userId":"05968237231871837168"}},"outputId":"4379a949-9e7e-4d25-adb8-3f4c1ae8cd55"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word: elif\n","elif is a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change an element works differently for each\n","\n","my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n","print(\"Original List:\", my_list)\n","my_list[1] = 99\n","print(\"Modified List:\", my_list)\n","  #for tuple\n","\n","my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)\n","print(\"Original Tuple:\", my_tuple)\n","my_tuple[1] = 99  #
